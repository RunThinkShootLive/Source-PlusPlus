MOD TEMPLATE CONCEPT:

GENERAL FIXES:
---------------------
Koneko: Restored the pistol shell ejection, replaced the HL1 .357 revolver worldmodel with a high quality one that uses Half-Life 2’s v_357.mdl as a base, fixed incorrect textures on the RPG worldmodel, increased detail on the AR2 worldmodel and made it so that the player holds the AR2 in both hands and not just one.
iohnnyboy: Provided fixes for the dropship gun and making it so the antlion acid doesn’t stick around flashing your screen.
